# Probabilistic UNet Pytorch

This is an implementation of the Probabilistic UNet in Pytorch.
The original code can be found at [this](https://github.com/stefanknegt/Probabilistic-Unet-Pytorch) link. 
We adapted it to improve readability and also ease of use for conducting experiments and doing inference.
